PERIOD 5
Nathan Lam, Jason Chan
Group Name:

We will be making a processing version of tetris, but with the added features of irregularly shaped blocks such as:

OOO        OO
O O  and OOO
OOO

This will also include the added ability to clear specific 3x3 squares instead of rows.  We plan to extend the column count from tetris' 10 to 12 to fit a multiple of 3 to make this convenient.
all other features will be directly the same as normal tetris: line clears, acceleration, score, color changes with levels, etc.

Minimum Viable Product:
a normal tetris game with 12 columns instead of 10, and more block types
Desired features: 3x3 clears, combo counter.
