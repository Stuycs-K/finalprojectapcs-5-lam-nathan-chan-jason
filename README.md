# Project Description

This is a game of Tetris, but with some extra modifications if you dare! There is a hard mode implemented, which adds extra types of tetrominos (inspired by Block Blast) to make the gameplay spicer. The board has also been widened to adjust to the higher level playing field.

# Intended usage:

At the start screen
Press TAB to start the game.
Press H to toggle hard mode.

During the game
Press the Left/Right arrow keys to move the tetromino left/right.
Press the Down arrow key to hard drop (place tetromino instantly).
Press SHIFT to soft drop (speed up tetromino).
Press Z and X to rotate the tetromino counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively.
Press C to hold.

After the game
Press ESC to quit the program.
