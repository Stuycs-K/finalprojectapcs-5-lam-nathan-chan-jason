### 2025-05-27 - planning + basic func
spent ~30 mins working out logic for rotation and how we should store tetrominoes, added basic set and get methods for the board array, will implement tetromino falling, rotation, and placement on the map tomorrow/at home today.

### 2025-05-28 - shape 3d arrays
spent class time inputting explicitly declared shape arrays into a 3d array with the 4 rotation states.  added those 3d arrays to a hash table for easy expansion.

at home resized the board and made the left-right shift function.
