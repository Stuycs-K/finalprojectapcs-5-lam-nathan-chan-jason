# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Nathan Lam, Jason Chan

# IDEAS:

1 Tetris+Block Blast: a combination of the classic tetris with block blast (or any other 9x9 block clearing puzzle game).  works like classic tetris but the blocks come in the absurd shapes that are common in said puzzle games.  The tradeoff is that you can now clear cubes in 3x3 boxes (but only in the specific grid squares);

2 Geometry Dash (with level editor): timing-based platformer rage game with cube that needs to jump over spikes and other hazards.  Implementation of a level editor using either a direct array edit or even a UI, time permitting.

3 Jetpack Joyride: physics & momentum based side scroller where the character flies using a machine gun pointed downwards.  dodging hazards like missiles and laser grids.  the side scrolling accelerates over time.  powerups in the form of mechanized vehicles are collectable during gameplay which shiled from one hit and provide a different form of mobility.
